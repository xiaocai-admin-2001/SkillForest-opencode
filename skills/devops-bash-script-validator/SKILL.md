# Bash Script Validator

## Overview

This skill validates Bash and POSIX shell scripts with layered checks:

1. Syntax validation (`bash -n` or `sh -n`)
2. ShellCheck static analysis (system binary or wrapper fallback)
3. Custom security, portability, and optimization checks

Use the default flow below, then branch to fallbacks only when the environment is constrained.

## Trigger Guidance

Use this skill when the request includes script quality, linting, syntax checking, or shell portability work.

### Trigger Phrases

- "Validate this bash script"
- "Lint this `.sh` file"
- "Find security issues in this shell script"
- "Why does this script fail ShellCheck?"
- "Make this script POSIX compliant"
- "Review this shell script before CI"

### Non-Trigger Examples

- General Linux command questions with no script file
- Kubernetes, Terraform, or pipeline validation tasks that do not involve shell scripts
- Pure prose editing tasks

## Deterministic Execution Model

Run commands from this skill directory:

```bash
cd devops-skills-plugin/skills/bash-script-validator
```

### Step 1: Preflight

1. Confirm target path exists and is readable.
2. Confirm `bash` is available.
3. Determine whether fixes can be applied directly (write access) or only suggested (read-only).

### Step 2: Run Baseline Validation (Default Path)

```bash
bash scripts/validate.sh <script-path>
```

For deterministic stage behavior, set the ShellCheck provider explicitly:

```bash
# Modes: auto (default), system, wrapper, disabled
VALIDATOR_SHELLCHECK_MODE=system bash scripts/validate.sh <script-path>
```

Record:

- Detected shell type
- Exit code (`0` clean, `1` warnings, `2` errors)
- All reported issue lines and ShellCheck codes (`SC####`) when present

### Step 3: Load Only Needed References

Progressive disclosure by issue type:

- ShellCheck code explanations: `docs/shellcheck-reference.md`
- General fix patterns and security mistakes: `docs/common-mistakes.md`
- Bash-only behavior: `docs/bash-reference.md`
- POSIX portability or bashism fixes: `docs/shell-reference.md`
- Text-processing optimization issues: `docs/grep-reference.md`, `docs/awk-reference.md`, `docs/sed-reference.md`, `docs/regex-reference.md` (only when directly relevant)

### Step 4: Provide or Apply Fixes

For each issue, include:

1. Exact location from validator output (line number and snippet)
2. Root cause
3. Corrected code
4. Why the change is safer or more portable
5. Subsection-level citation (format below)

If the request includes patching files and write access is available, apply fixes in small batches grouped by issue type.

### Step 5: Rerun Policy (Mandatory After Changes)

After each batch of edits, rerun the validator:

```bash
bash scripts/validate.sh <script-path>
```

Rerun loop rules:

1. Continue until no new errors are introduced.
2. If warnings remain by design, document why they are intentionally accepted.
3. If constraints prevent full resolution, report unresolved items with a clear next action.
4. Always report the latest rerun exit code and remaining issue count.

## Fallback Behavior

Use these branches only when the default flow cannot run as-is.

| Constraint | Fallback action | Reporting requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shellcheck` missing, wrapper available | Let `scripts/validate.sh` use `scripts/shellcheck_wrapper.sh --cache` automatically | State that wrapper mode was used |
| `shellcheck` and wrapper unavailable | Run syntax + custom checks only (validator does this) | Explicitly call out reduced coverage and missing ShellCheck analysis |
| Python unavailable for wrapper | Skip wrapper path, keep syntax + custom checks | State why ShellCheck could not run |
| Target file is read-only | Provide precise patch suggestions without editing | Mark response as "advisory only" |
| Target file missing or unreadable | Stop and request a valid file path | Do not fabricate results |
| Binary/non-text input | Stop validation | Report unsupported input type |

## Citation Guidance for Fixes

Use subsection-level citations for every non-trivial fix.

Required citation format:

```text
Reference: docs/<file>.md -> <Section> -> <Subsection>
```

Examples:

- `Reference: docs/common-mistakes.md -> 1. Unquoted Variables -> Solution`
- `Reference: docs/shellcheck-reference.md -> SC2164: Use || exit After cd`
- `Reference: docs/shell-reference.md -> POSIX Best Practices -> 5. Avoid Bashisms`

Citation rules:

1. Cite the most specific section that justifies the fix.
2. For ShellCheck findings, include both the `SC####` code and the matching section.
3. If no exact subsection exists, cite the closest section and state that the fix is inferred from that guidance.

## Response Template

Use this structure for deterministic output:

- `Validation Results`
- `Command`: `bash scripts/validate.sh <script-path>`
- `Detected shell`: `<shell>`
- `Exit code`: `<code>`
- `Summary`: `<errors> errors, <warnings> warnings, <info> info`
- `Issue`: `<short label> (Line <n>)`
- `Problem`:
  ```bash
  <problematic snippet>
  ```
- `Fix`:
  ```bash
  <corrected snippet>
  ```
- `Why`: `<short explanation>`
- `Reference`: `docs/<file>.md -> <Section> -> <Subsection>`
- `Rerun command`: `bash scripts/validate.sh <script-path>`
- `Exit code after fixes`: `<code>`
- `Remaining issues`: `<count or none>`

## Example Flows

### Fully Automated Environment

```bash
# 1) Baseline validation
bash scripts/validate.sh examples/bad-bash.sh

# 2) Apply fixes to target script
# 3) Rerun validation
bash scripts/validate.sh examples/bad-bash.sh
```

Expected behavior: full syntax + ShellCheck + custom-check coverage, with iterative reruns until stable.

### Deterministic CI Gate

```bash
# Requires a system shellcheck binary.
bash scripts/run_ci_checks.sh
```

This runner enforces `VALIDATOR_REQUIRE_SHELLCHECK=1` and `VALIDATOR_SHELLCHECK_MODE=system`
so CI fails if the ShellCheck stage is skipped or unavailable.

### Constrained Environment (No ShellCheck Runtime)

```bash
# shellcheck unavailable and wrapper cannot run
bash scripts/validate.sh examples/bad-shell.sh
```

Expected behavior: syntax + custom checks still run. Report reduced coverage and list what must be revalidated once ShellCheck is available.

## Validator Script Details

### Scripts

- `scripts/validate.sh`: primary validator entrypoint
- `scripts/shellcheck_wrapper.sh`: optional ShellCheck fallback using a cached Python virtual environment

### Detection and Ordering

Validation order in `scripts/validate.sh`:

1. File checks (exists/readable/text)
2. Shebang-based shell detection
3. Syntax check
4. ShellCheck (or fallback/skip behavior)
5. Custom checks
6. Summary with exit code

### Exit Codes

- `0`: no issues found
- `1`: warnings found
- `2`: errors found

## References

Load only what is needed:

- `docs/bash-reference.md`
- `docs/shell-reference.md`
- `docs/shellcheck-reference.md`
- `docs/common-mistakes.md`
- `docs/grep-reference.md`
- `docs/awk-reference.md`

## Done Criteria

This skill update is complete when all are true:

1. Trigger guidance is explicit (positive and non-trigger examples).
2. Default workflow is deterministic and ordered.
3. Fallback behavior is explicit for missing tooling and constrained environments.
4. Fix explanations include subsection-level citations.
5. Post-fix rerun policy is mandatory and reported with exit codes.
6. Documentation supports both fully automated and constrained execution paths.
