## Actions

### setup-node-cached/action.yml
Composite action for Node.js setup demonstrating:
- Smart dependency caching for npm, yarn, and pnpm
- Input validation
- Multiple package manager support
- Cache hit detection
- Grouped output for better logging

**Use case:** Reusable Node.js setup across multiple workflows

## Usage

These examples can be used as:
1. **Templates** - Copy and modify for your own projects
2. **Learning Resources** - Study best practices and patterns
3. **Testing** - Validate with github-actions-validator skill

## Testing Examples

To validate any of these examples:

```bash
cd devops-skills-plugin/skills/github-actions-validator
bash scripts/validate_workflow.sh ../../github-actions-generator/examples/workflows/nodejs-ci.yml
```

## Best Practices Demonstrated

All examples follow these best practices:
- ✅ Actions pinned to SHAs with version comments
- ✅ Minimal permissions with explicit `permissions:` blocks
- ✅ Concurrency controls to prevent duplicate runs
- ✅ Proper timeout settings
- ✅ Semantic naming conventions
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Security-first approach
