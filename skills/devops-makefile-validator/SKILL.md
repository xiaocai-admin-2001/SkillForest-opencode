# Makefile Validator

## Overview

Use this skill to validate Makefiles with a local-first, deterministic flow.

Default validator entrypoint:

```bash
bash scripts/validate_makefile.sh <makefile-path>
```

Validation layers:

1. Dependency preflight (`python3`, `pip3`, `make`)
2. GNU make syntax check (`make -n --dry-run`) when `make` is available
3. `mbake validate`
4. `mbake format --check`
5. Custom security, best-practice, and optimization checks
6. Optional `checkmake` and `unmake` checks when installed

## Trigger Guidance

Use this skill when the request includes Makefile quality, linting, validation, hardening, or troubleshooting.

### Trigger Phrases

- "Validate this Makefile"
- "Lint my `.mk` file"
- "Find issues in this build Makefile"
- "Check Makefile security problems"
- "Review this Makefile before CI"

### Non-Trigger Examples

- Creating a brand new Makefile from scratch (use `makefile-generator`)
- Running build targets as part of delivery
- General shell scripting work unrelated to Makefiles

## Deterministic Execution Model

Run from this skill directory for shortest commands:

```bash
cd devops-skills-plugin/skills/makefile-validator
```

### Step 1: Preflight

1. Confirm target file exists and is readable.
2. Confirm whether file edits are allowed (`writable`) or only suggestions can be returned (`read-only`).
3. Prefer the default validator path first; use fallbacks only when blocked by environment constraints.

### Step 2: Baseline Validation (Default Path)

```bash
# From skill directory
bash scripts/validate_makefile.sh <makefile-path>

# From repository root
bash devops-skills-plugin/skills/makefile-validator/scripts/validate_makefile.sh <makefile-path>
```

Always record:

- command executed
- exit code
- summary counts (`Errors`, `Warnings`, `Info`)
- issue locations reported by tools

### Step 3: Interpret Output and Exit Code

| Exit code | Meaning | Expected summary line | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | no blocking findings | `Validation PASSED` | optional improvements only |
| `1` | warning-only result | `Validation PASSED with warnings` | fix recommended; merge policy dependent |
| `2` | error result | `Validation FAILED - errors must be fixed` | fix required, then rerun |

### Step 4: Progressive Reference Loading

Open only the docs required by the current findings.

| Finding type | Reference doc |
| --- | --- |
| `.PHONY`, `.DELETE_ON_ERROR`, `.ONESHELL`, variable usage, performance structure | `docs/best-practices.md` |
| tabs vs spaces, dependency mistakes, credential patterns, anti-patterns | `docs/common-mistakes.md` |
| `mbake` behavior, formatter flags, known `mbake` caveats | `docs/bake-tool.md` |

### Step 5: Fix + Rerun Loop

After applying fixes, rerun:

```bash
bash scripts/validate_makefile.sh <makefile-path>
```

Loop rules:

1. Stop only when no new errors are introduced.
2. If warnings remain intentionally, document why they are accepted.
3. Always report the latest rerun exit code.

## How to Open Docs

Use explicit file-open commands so paths are unambiguous.

From repository root:

```bash
sed -n '1,220p' devops-skills-plugin/skills/makefile-validator/docs/best-practices.md
sed -n '1,220p' devops-skills-plugin/skills/makefile-validator/docs/common-mistakes.md
sed -n '1,220p' devops-skills-plugin/skills/makefile-validator/docs/bake-tool.md
rg -n "PHONY|DELETE_ON_ERROR|ONESHELL|tab|credential|mbake" devops-skills-plugin/skills/makefile-validator/docs/*.md
```

From `devops-skills-plugin/skills/makefile-validator`:

```bash
sed -n '1,220p' docs/best-practices.md
sed -n '1,220p' docs/common-mistakes.md
sed -n '1,220p' docs/bake-tool.md
rg -n "PHONY|DELETE_ON_ERROR|ONESHELL|tab|credential|mbake" docs/*.md
```

If shell commands are unavailable, use the environment's file-open/read actions on the same paths.

## Fallback Behavior

Use these only when the default validator path cannot run fully.

| Constraint | Fallback action | Reporting requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python3` or `pip3` unavailable | Run limited checks (`make -f <file> -n --dry-run` if `make` exists, plus focused `grep` checks) | State that `mbake` stages were skipped and coverage is reduced |
| `pip3 install mbake` fails (offline/proxy/index issue) | Keep syntax/custom checks that still work; defer formatter/linter stages | Report install failure and request rerun in a network-enabled environment |
| `make` unavailable | Continue with non-syntax stages; script already downgrades syntax stage | Explicitly note syntax coverage was skipped |
| `checkmake` or `unmake` unavailable | Continue; these are optional stages | Note optional lint/portability coverage not executed |
| target file is read-only | Provide patch suggestions only | Mark response as advisory only |
| command execution unavailable | Provide static review from file contents and docs | Mark result as non-executed analysis |

Minimal fallback commands:

```bash
# Syntax only (when make exists)
make -f <makefile-path> -n --dry-run

# Focused quick checks
grep -n "^\\.DELETE_ON_ERROR:" <makefile-path>
grep -n "^\\.PHONY:" <makefile-path>
grep -nE "^(  |    |        )[a-zA-Z@\\$\\(]" <makefile-path>
```

## Example Outcomes Mapped to Exit Codes

### Clean Result (`exit 0`)

```text
Errors:   0
Warnings: 0
Info:     2
✓ Validation PASSED
```

### Warning-Only Result (`exit 1`)

```text
Errors:   0
Warnings: 3
Info:     1
⚠ Validation PASSED with warnings
```

### Error Result (`exit 2`)

```text
Errors:   2
Warnings: 1
Info:     0
⚠ Validation FAILED - errors must be fixed
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Start

1. Verify required tools:

```bash
command -v python3 pip3 make
```

2. Isolate GNU make syntax failures:

```bash
make -f <makefile-path> -n --dry-run
```

3. Check likely tab-indentation violations:

```bash
grep -nE "^(  |    |        )[a-zA-Z@\\$\\(]" <makefile-path>
```

4. Rerun validator with plain output and capture log:

```bash
NO_COLOR=1 bash scripts/validate_makefile.sh <makefile-path> > /tmp/makefile-validator.log 2>&1
echo "exit=$? log=/tmp/makefile-validator.log"
```

5. If mbake install keeps failing, validate in a network-enabled shell or with an internal PyPI mirror, then rerun the full validator.

## Done Criteria

This skill update is complete when all are true:

1. Trigger guidance is explicit and easy to identify.
2. Execution flow is deterministic (preflight -> run -> interpret -> docs -> rerun).
3. "How to open docs" instructions include exact commands and paths.
4. Example outcomes are explicitly tied to exit codes (`0`, `1`, `2`).
5. Fallback behavior is documented for missing tools and constrained environments.
6. Troubleshooting quick-start is concise and runnable.
7. Frontmatter `name` and `description` remain unchanged.
